# QEMU RISC-V virt machine memory map
#
# The virt machine has configurable RAM starting at 0x80000000.
# We'll use a modest 16MB for now (QEMU default is 128MB).
# Flash is emulated as RAM since virt doesn't have real flash.

# "Flash" region - actually RAM, but we treat it as read-only + execute
# for code. QEMU virt loads firmware here.
